Name is Dylan and I got a passion and heavy career driven desire to excel in software development and software security. Currently trying to learn how to program secure software that mitigates as much threats as possible (eg. XSS attacks, OAuth, Access-Control, Injections, deserialization, and Buffer Overflow). Come check out my journey in building up my Full-stack skills as well as possible frameworks whilst discovering possible bugs/threats~ :)
